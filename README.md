# Detecting-Similar-Records-with-Multi-Threading-in-Big-Data
A project I made a while ago for one of my classes. It takes bank data as a CSV file
and edits the Product, Issues, State Code and ZIP Code columns to not contain any empty space or unwanted characters which was specified on the project file.
After all is done the code detects similar records and gives the user a Similarity Rate between all of the records.
